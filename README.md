# C++ Linked List Demo

This demo creates three classes: Node, LinkedListNode, and LinkedList. LinkedListNode is derived from Node to demonstrate inheritence. LinkedListNode implements LinkedList as a friend class to demonstrate friendship access. For simplicity LinkedList has a variation of four methods: the constructor, public/private reversePrint, public/private print, and public push. The main function in LinkedListDemo.cc demonstrates pushing various data types into multiple LinkedList objects and printing them.

## Getting Started

Just pull the files into your linux directory and compile with the at least the c++11 standard library.

### Prerequisites

[//]: # (What things you need to install the software and how to install them)

[//]: # (```)

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
